# Adobe Experience Cloud & Apple’s IDFA Announcement

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="As of Aug 18, 2020" %}
### What’s changed?

Apple recently announced [new changes](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/) to iOS 14, which are scheduled to take effect later in 2020.   Among the highlights of the changes: 

1. New notices of app developer’s data practices on store listings 
2. A new app tracking transparency framework; and
3. Users will now have more granular controls regarding geolocation data sharing \(e.g., proximity rather than precise geo\).

### Next Steps & Industry Reaction

Apple continues to release new details regarding these changes, and fuller business, legal, and technical impact assessments will follow accordingly. On the legal and technical sides, these changes raise questions as to how to best effectuate consumer rights and choices under laws like GDPR, CCPA, and the like. 

In terms of early reactions, the US ad trades are still evaluating and further preparing responses. [The Association of National Advertisers \(ANA\)](https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/60948) expressed concerns about the impact these changes would have on personalization, measurement and marketing communications, underscoring the importance of having a coordinated ecosystem wide solution not determined by a single company.  

IAB Europe released a letter to Tim Cook on July 2, “Marketing professionals urge Apple to adopt standards promoting interoperability and more predictable user privacy”, along with concerns about developers’ abilities to continue to meet their legal obligations under the announced guidelines.

Given that these developments are taking place against the backdrop of broader changes to addressable communications in the wider ecosystem \(e.g., browser changes\) Adobe is engaged in the appropriate policy and technical forums to work on these important issues.
