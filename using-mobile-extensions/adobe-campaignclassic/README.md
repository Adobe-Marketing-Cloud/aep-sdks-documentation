### Configure Campaign Classic extension

![Configuring the Campaign Classic extension](../../.gitbook/assets/acc-configure-extension.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
You can retrieve your Campaign Classic registration or tracking endpoint URLs in the Campaign Classic interface under the **Tools > Advanced > Deployment wizard** menu. The endpoint for push notifications is usually the same as the URL that is used for web forms and surveys.
{% endhint %}

#### Registration endpoints

Type the registration endpoint URL(s) for your Campaign Classic instances. You can specify up to three unique endpoints for your development, staging, and production environments.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For this extension, the registration endpoint URLs should be entered **without** a prefixing `https://.`
{% endhint %}

#### Tracking endpoints

Type the tracking endpoint URL(s) for your Campaign Classic instances. Like the registration URLs, you can specify up to three unique endpoints for your development, staging, and production environments.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For this extension, the tracking endpoint URLs should be entered **without** a prefixing `https://.`
{% endhint %}

#### Integration key (iOS)

You can specify up to three unique iOS integration keys for your development, staging, and production environments. iOS integration keys are generated after creating a service that contains iOS applications using the [Campaign Classic client console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/installing-campaign-classic/connect-to-campaign/installing-the-client-console.html). For more information on where to find the integration key, see the tutorial on [configuring the mobile application in Adobe Campaign](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-push-notifications/configure-the-mobile-app/configuring-the-mobile-application.html).

#### Integration key (Android)

You can specify up to three unique Android integration keys for your development, staging, and production environments. Android integration keys are generated after creating a service that contains Android applications using the [Campaign Classic client console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/installing-campaign-classic/connect-to-campaign/installing-the-client-console.html). For more information on where to find the integration key, see the tutorial on [configuring the mobile application in Adobe Campaign](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-push-notifications/configure-the-mobile-app/configuring-the-mobile-application-android.html).

#### Request timeout

The request timeout is the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the registration or tracking endpoint before timing out. The SDK default timeout value is 30 seconds.

## Add Campaign Classic to your app

#### Java

1. Add the Campaign Classic extension to your project using the app's Gradle file.

   ```java
   implementation 'com.adobe.marketing.mobile:sdk-core:1.+'
   implementation 'com.adobe.marketing.mobile:campaignclassic:1.+'
   ```

   or you can manually include the binaries found in the [acp-sdks](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks/) repo on GitHub.

2. Import the Campaign Classic, Mobile Core, and Lifecycle extensions in your application's main activity.

   ```java
   import com.adobe.marketing.mobile.MobileCore;
   import com.adobe.marketing.mobile.CampaignClassic;

   ```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS (AEP 3.x)" %}

1. Add the Campaign Classic and [Mobile Core](../../foundation-extensions/mobile-core/) libraries to your project.

   You can add the following pods to your `Podfile`:

   ```text
   pod 'AEPCore'
   pod 'AEPCampaignClassic'
   ```

   or you can manually include the XCFrameworks by following this GitHub [documentation](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-campaignclassic-ios/#binaries).

2. In the Xcode project, import the Mobile Core and Campaign Classic extensions:

**Swift**

```swift

public class CampaignClassicTestApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        MobileCore.setApplication(this);
        MobileCore.setLogLevel(LoggingMode.VERBOSE);

        try {
            CampaignClassic.registerExtension();
            Lifecycle.registerExtension();
            MobileCore.start(null);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e("CampaignClassicTestApp", e.getMessage());
        }

    }
}

```swift
// AppDelegate.swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
  MobileCore.registerExtensions([CampaignClassic.self], {
    MobileCore.configureWith(appId: "APP-ID")
  })
  return true;
}
```

#### Objective-C

```objectivec
// AppDelegate.m
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [AEPMobileCore registerExtensions:@[AEPMobileCampaignClassic.class] completion:^{
    [AEPMobileCore configureWithAppId: @"APP-ID"];
  }];
  return YES;
}

   ACPLifecycle.registerExtension();
  // Override point for customization after application launch.
  return true;
}
```

#### Objective-C

```objectivec
// AppDelegate.m
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [ACPCampaignClassic registerExtension];
