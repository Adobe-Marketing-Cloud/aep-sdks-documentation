# Release Notes

## October 12, 2022

### iOS AEPTarget 3.3.0

* Added support for remote property token (`at_property`) updates via Experience Platform Data Collection rules.
* Added support for raw Target APIs to fetch mbox content and to send notifications to Adobe Target.
  * The `executeRawRequest` API can be used to prefetch or execute mbox locations (even non-unique mbox locations). The API callback will be invoked with the full response data from Adobe Target if the request is successful, or with an error message otherwise.
  * The `sendRawNotifications` API can be used to send display or click notifications to Adobe Target. The event token required for these requests can be retrieved from the response of a prior prefetch or execute call via `executeRawRequest` API.

### Android Target 1.4.0

* Added support for raw Target APIs to fetch mbox content and to send notifications to Adobe Target.
  * The `executeRawRequest` API can be used to prefetch or execute mbox locations (even non-unique mbox locations). The API callback will be invoked with the full response data from Adobe Target if the request is successful, or with a null value otherwise.
  * The `sendRawNotifications` API can be used to send display or click notifications to Adobe Target. The event token required for these requests can be retrieved from the response of a prior prefetch or execute call via `executeRawRequest` API.

### Adobe Target extension 2.5.0

* Added support for a new Event Type `Raw Request` in Adobe Target extension for creating rules on the Experience Platform Data Collection UI. This can be used for handling advanced scenarios when using the raw Target APIs.

## August 2, 2022

### Android Target 1.3.0

Added getter and setter APIs for Target tnt IDs and session IDs to enable cross-channel sessions.

* The `setSessionId` API should be invoked prior to any Target request to prevent the Mobile SDK from generating a session ID locally. The set session ID will follow the session expiry as governed by the `target.sessionTimeout` configuration setting. You can use this API in conjunction with `setTntId` API to set both of the value in the SDK.
* The `setTntId` API, when invoked, also sets the Target edge host value in the SDK by deriving it from the profile location hint supplied in the tnt ID.
* The `getSessionId` and `getTntId` APIs can be used to retrieve the current Target session ID and tnt ID values respectively.

### iOS AEPTarget 3.1.3

* Fixed an issue where the Target display notification was not being sent to the server, upon invoking `displayedLocations` API, if a prior prefetch call did not return profile state token for the mbox.

## November 19, 2021

* Fixed an issue where the Target qaMode parameters were not being attached to the `retrieveLocationContent` API requests, once the Target preview selections were confirmed.

## October 22, 2021

## August 23, 2021

### Android Target 1.2.8

* Added support for sending the click conversion A4T payload to Adobe Analytics for A4T-enabled Target activities when the `locationClicked` API is called.

## August 5, 2021

### Android Target 1.2.7

* `TargetRequest` class now provides a constructor with a new callback interface named `AdobeTargetDetailedCallback`. When implemented, the callback method provides:
  * Target content; AND
  * Data payload map containing one or more of response tokens, Analytics payload, click metric Analytics payload \(if available in the Target retrieve location content response with/ without a prior prefetch call\)

**Note**: This SDK extension, per previous behavior, will make requests to Adobe Analytics \(if the Adobe Analytics extension is also implemented\) with appropriate Target payloads for A4T functionality.

### iOS AEPTarget 3.1.0

* `TargetRequest` class now provides a constructor with a new callback function named `contentWithDataCallback`. When implemented, this callback provides:
  * Target content; AND
  * Data payload dictionary containing one or more of response tokens, Analytics payload, click metric Analytics payload \(if available in the Target retrieve location content response with/ without a prior prefetch call\)

**Note**: This SDK extension, per previous behavior, will make requests to Adobe Analytics \(if the Adobe Analytics extension is also implemented\) with appropriate Target payloads for A4T functionality.

* Fixed an issue where the click notification was not being sent to Adobe Target for a retrieved mbox location upon the `clickedLocation` API call.
* Added support for sending the click conversion A4T payload to Adobe Analytics for A4T-enabled Target activities when the `clickedLocation` API is called.

## June 15, 2021

### Android Target 1.1.7

* Added the changes to move away from bintray and start using Sonatype to push the SDK to Maven Central.

## December 18, 2020
