# XDM Experience Events

The Adobe Experience Platform Edge extension can send events that follow a previously defined XDM schema to Adobe Experience Edge Network. This extension automatically adds Identity information to each Experience event as described in this document.

## Event structure

{% hint style="info" %}
This extension provides public APIs to build XDM Experience events; these events **should not** be confused with the events that are built by using the `Mobile Core` extension, as they are built based on XDM schemas.
{% endhint %}

An XDM Experience event has the following structure:

| Data | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Timestamp | _\(Required\)_ The auto populated timestamp when the Experience Platform event is sent to the AEP Edge mobile extension. |
| Event ID | _\(Required\)_ Unique event identifier that is auto generated by the SDK. |
| Event type | _\(Required\)_ The event type, for example `commerce:orderDetails`. Refer to [xdm:eventType Known Values](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/master/docs/reference/classes/experienceevent.schema.md#xdmeventtype-known-values) for more examples. |
| XDM data | _\(Required\)_ Data following the XDM schema that is defined in the Schema Editor. |
| Data | _\(Optional\)_ The JSON-formatted, free-form data that can be associated with an event. |
| Dataset ID | _\(Optional\)_ Using the AEP Edge extension, you can send data to multiple datasets based on your needs and configuration in Adobe Experience Platform. When sending an Experience event and providing a dataset identifier, the dataset ID will be used for redirecting the data to the specified AEP Dataset instead of the default dataset set in the Experience Edge Configuration. |

## Identity

Here are the identity properties the AEP Edge mobile extension automatically adds to each Experience event:

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ECID | The Experience Cloud Identifier \(ECID\)  that is generated by the Adobe Experiece Platform Mobile SDK is added to the Experience event's `XDM IdentityMap` . |
