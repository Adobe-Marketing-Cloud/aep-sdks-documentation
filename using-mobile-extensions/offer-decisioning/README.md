# Adobe Experience Platform Offer Decisioning

[Adobe Experience Platform Offer Decisioning](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-platform/offer-decisioning.html) mobile extension can deliver personalized offers that are managed in Offer Decisioning. You can create your offers and other related objects using the Offer Decisioning user interface \(UI\) or APIs. To learn more about Offer Decisioning, please refer to [Offer Decisioning product documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/offer-decisioning/using/offer-decisioning-home.html?lang=en).

## Prerequisites

* IMS organization is enabled for edge decisioning
* Offers and Activities are created
* Adobe Experience Platform Core and Edge mobile extensions have been implemented in the app
* Launch UI config is published

## Limitations

Some offer constraints are currently not supported with the mobile Experience Edge workflows, for example `Capping`. The `Capping` field value specifies the number of times an offer can be presented across all users. For more details, see [Offer eligibility rules and constraints guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/offer-decisioning/using/managing-offers-in-the-offer-library/creating-personalized-offers.html#eligibility).

## Enable Offer Decisioning in Datastream configuration

To enable Offer Decisioning, you need to perform the following steps:

1. In Adobe Experience Platform Launch, navigate to the `Datastreams` from the left panel, then select the configuration that needs to be updated.

   Enable Adobe Experience Platform in your [datastream configuration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/datastreams.html) and check the `Offer Decisioning` box.

#### Java

```java
public class MobileApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
      super.onCreate();
      MobileCore.setApplication(this);
      MobileCore.configureWithAppID("yourAppId");

      try {
        Edge.registerExtension(); 
        Identity.registerExtension();
        Lifecycle.registerExtension();
        OfferDecisioning.registerExtension(); //Register OfferDecisioning extension
        MobileCore.start(new AdobeCallback() {
          @Override
          public void call(final Object o) {
            // processing after start
          }});
      } catch (Exception e) {
        //Log the exception
      }
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS — Swift" %}
#### Swift

```swift
import UIKit
import AEPCore
import AEPEdge
import AEPIdentity
import AEPLifecycle
import AEPSignal
import AEPOfferDecisioning

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        MobileCore.configureWith(appId: YOUR_APP_ID)

        // register Mobile Core and AEP Edge extensions
        MobileCore.registerExtensions([Edge.self, Identity.self, Lifecycle.self, Signal.self, OfferDecisioning.self])

        return true
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Prefetch and retrieve offers

After you get everything correctly set up, you can now use the AEP Offer Decisioning extension to prefetch and retrieve the offers and then render the content in your app.

### Decision Scope

For Offer Decisioning, Decision Scope is the JSON data structure which contains the activity and placement IDs you want the offer decisioning service to use to propose offers.

_Decision scope JSON:_

```javascript
{
  "activityId":"xcore:offer-activity:11cfb1fa93381aca",
  "placementId":"xcore:offer-placement:1175009612b0100c"
}
```

AEP Offer Decisioning extension provides a convenient class for you to construct the Decision Scope.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}
#### Java

```java
DecisionScope decisionScope = new DecisionScope("xcore:offer-activity:11cfb1fa93381aca", "xcore:offer-placement:1175009612b0100c");
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS — Swift" %}
#### Swift

```swift
let decisionScope = DecisionScope(activityId: "xcore:offer-activity:11cfb1fa93381aca", placementId: "xcore:offer-placement:1175009612b0100c")
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Prefetch offers

AEP Offer Decisioning exension provides separate APIs to prefetch the offers and retrieves the offer contents. This design aims to help apps to build better user experience for their end users. We recommend the app to prefetch the offers in advance, so there is no latency by the time you retrieve the offer contents and render them.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}
#### Java

```java
// prefetch offers for decision scopes
OfferDecisioning.prefetchOffers(Arrays.asList(
                        new DecisionScope("xcore:offer-activity:11cfb1fa93381aca", "xcore:offer-placement:1175009612b0100c"),
                        new DecisionScope("xcore:offer-activity:11cfb1fa93381aca", "xcore:offer-placement:1175009612b0100d")));
// prefetch offers for decision scopes with additional expxperience event
OfferExperienceEvent exEvent = new OfferExperienceEvent(
                        new HashMap<String, Object>() {
                            {
                                put("xdmkey", "xdmvalue");
                            }
                        },null,"override-datasetId");
OfferDecisioning.prefetchOffers(Arrays.asList(
                        new DecisionScope("xcore:offer-activity:11cfb1fa93381aca", "xcore:offer-placement:1175009612b0100c"),
                        new DecisionScope("xcore:offer-activity:11cfb1fa93381aca", "xcore:offer-placement:1175009612b0100d")),
                        exEvent);
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS — Swift" %}
#### Swift

```swift
let decisionScope1 = DecisionScope(activityId: "xcore:offer-activity:11cfb1fa93381aca", placementId: "xcore:offer-placement:1175009612b0100c")
let decisionScope2 = DecisionScope(activityId: "xcore:offer-activity:11cfb1fa93381aca", placementId: "xcore:offer-placement:1175009612b0100d")

OfferDecisioning.prefetchOffers(decisionScopes: [decisionScope1, decisionScope2])

// prefetch offers for decision scopes
OfferDecisioning.prefetchOffers(decisionScopes: [decisionScope1, decisionScope2])

// prefetch offers for decision scopes with additional expxperience event 
let experienceEvent = OfferExperienceEvent(xdm: ["xdmkey": "xdmvalue"], data: nil, datasetIdentifier: "override-datasetId")

OfferDecisioning.prefetchOffers(decisionScopes: [decisionScope1, decisionScope2], experienceEvent: experienceEvent)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Retrieve offers content

Once the offers have been prefetched, use the `retrievePrefetchedOffers` API to get the contents for the targeted decision scopes.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}

#### Java

```java
OfferDecisioning.retrievePrefetchedOffers(Arrays.asList(
                new DecisionScope("xcore:offer-activity:11cfb1fa93381aca", "xcore:offer-placement:1175009612b0100c")),
                new AdobeCallbackWithError<Map<DecisionScope, List<Offer>>>() {
                    @Override
                    public void fail(AdobeError adobeError) {

                    }
                    @Override
                    public void call(Map<DecisionScope, List<Offer>> decisionScopeListMap) {
                        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
                        // render the offer with offer.content
                    }
                });
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS — Swift" %}
#### Swift

```swift
let decisionScope = DecisionScope(activityId: "xcore:offer-activity:11cfb1fa93381aca", placementId: "xcore:offer-placement:1175009612b0100c")

OfferDecisioning.retrievePrefetchedOffers(decisionScopes: [decisionScope]) {        offersDict, _ in

  // handle response
  if let offers = offersDict[decisionScope] {
    let offer = offers[0]
    // render the offer with offer.content
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Listen for offer update

Offer prefetch can not only be triggered by the aforementioned `prefetchOffers` API, calling `Edge.sendEvent()` or using Rules are alternate approaches to prefetch offers. AEP Offer Decisioning extension is listening for all the responses from Offer Decisioning Services, no matter how the requests are triggered.

The app can register a listener for offer update, so it is notified whenever there are new offers being cached or updated.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="iOS — Swift" %}
#### Swift

```swift
OfferDecisioning.onOfferUpdate { offersDict in
      // handle offers
      print("\(propositions as AnyObject)")
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
