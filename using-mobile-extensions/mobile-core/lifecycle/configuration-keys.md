## lifecycle.sessionTimeout

Specifies the length of time, in seconds, that must elapse between the time the app is launched and before the launch is considered to be a new session. This timeout also applies when your application is sent to the background and reactivated.

Default value is 300 seconds \(5 minutes\).

The time that your app spends in the background is not included in the session length.
