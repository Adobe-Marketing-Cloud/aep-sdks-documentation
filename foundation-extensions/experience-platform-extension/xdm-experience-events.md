# XDM Experience Events

The Adobe Experience Platform Edge extension can send events that follow a previously defined XDM schema to Adobe Experience Edge Network. This extension automatically adds Identity information to each Experience event as described in this document.

## Event structure

{% hint style="info" %}
This extension provides public APIs to build XDM Experience events; these events **should not** be confused with the events that are built by using the `Mobile Core` extension, as they are built based on XDM schemas.
{% endhint %}

An XDM Experience event has the following structure:

| Data | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Timestamp | _\(Required\)_ The auto populated timestamp when the Experience Platform event is sent to the AEP Edge mobile extension. |
| Event ID | _\(Required\)_ Unique event identifier that is auto generated by the SDK. |
| Event type | _\(Required\)_ The event type, for example `commerce:orderDetails`. Refer to [xdm:eventType Known Values](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/master/docs/reference/classes/experienceevent.schema.md#xdmeventtype-known-values) for more examples. |
| XDM data | _\(Required\)_ Data following the XDM schema that is defined in the Schema Editor. |
| Data | _\(Optional\)_ The JSON-formatted, free-form data that can be associated with an event. |
| Dataset ID | _\(Optional\)_ Using the AEP Edge extension, you can send data to multiple datasets based on your needs and configuration in Adobe Experience Platform. When sending an Experience event and providing a dataset identifier, this identifier is used for redirecting the data to the specified AEP Dataset instead of the default dataset set in the Datastream configuration. |

## Identity

Here are the identity properties the AEP Edge mobile extension automatically adds to each Experience event:

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ECID | The Experience Cloud Identifier \(ECID\)  that is generated by the Adobe Experiece Platform Mobile SDK is added to the Experience event's `XDM IdentityMap` . |

# Implementation Details

Implementation details are automatically collected by the Edge Network extension and are sent with every Experience Event. The implementation details format is defined in [XDM](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/master/components/datatypes/industry-verticals/implementationdetails.schema.json).

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Version | The version string is a concatenation of the AEP Mobile Core extension version plus the Edge Network extension version. |
| Name | The name is a unique URI identifier for the Mobile SDK on each supported platform. |
| Environment | For a mobile application the environment is always `app`.|

The implementation details are used by the Adobe Platform Edge Network to identify the SDK sending Experience Events. However, if you would like to include this information in your dataset, add the "Implementation Details" field group to the schema tied to your dataset.
