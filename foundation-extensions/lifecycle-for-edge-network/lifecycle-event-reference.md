# Lifecycle for Edge Network event reference
## Events dispatched by Lifecycle for Edge Network

{% hint style="info" %}
The following events are dispatched within the Mobile SDK. To forward the event data to the AEP Edge Network, follow the steps outlined in [Configure Forward to Edge Rule in Launch](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/foundation-extensions/lifecycle-for-edge-network#configure-forward-to-edge-rule-in-launch). 
{% endhint %}

### Lifecycle Application Foreground
This event is a response from the Lifecycle for Edge Network extension to notify the application is being displayed in the foreground. The event is generated by the Lifecycle for Edge Network extension when the [lifecycleStart](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/foundation-extensions/mobile-core/lifecycle/lifecycle-api-reference#lifecycle-start) API is called, typically when the application comes to the foreground of the device.

{% hint style="info" %}
In Android, there is a two (2) second timeout between consecutive `lifecycleStart` and `lifecyclePause` events to prevent dispatching of events due to switching between Android Activities.
{% endhint %}

| :--- | :--- |
| com.adobe.eventType.lifecycle | com.adobe.eventSource.applicationLaunch |

#### Data payload
The Lifecycle Application Foreground data payload is defined by the AEP Mobile Lifecycle Details XDM field group, and includes information about the application, device, and environment when the event occurred. Please refer to [Lifecycle Application Foreground metrics](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/foundation-extensions/lifecycle-for-edge-network/lifecycle-metrics#lifecycle-application-foreground-metrics) for a list of metrics included with this event.

### Lifecycle Application Background
This event is a response from the Lifecycle for Edge Network extension to notify the application is in the background. 

The event is generated by the Lifecycle for Edge Network extension when:

1. the `lifecyclePause` API is called, typically when the application goes to the background of the device.
2. the `lifecycleStart` API is called without a previous call to `lifecyclePause` (such as when the application terminates unexpectedly). In this case, a Lifecycle Application Background event is dispatched just before the Lifecycle Application Foreground event, however the background event's timestamp is backdated to a time before the application previously went in the background.

{% hint style="info" %}
In Android, there is a two (2) second timeout between consecutive `lifecycleStart` and `lifecyclePause` events to prevent dispatching of events due to switching between Android Activities.
{% endhint %}

#### Data payload
The Lifecycle Application Background data payload is defined by the AEP Mobile Lifecycle Details XDM field group, and includes information about the application close type and previous session length. Please refer to [Lifecycle Application Background metrics](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/foundation-extensions/lifecycle-for-edge-network/lifecycle-metrics#lifecycle-application-background-metrics) for a list of metrics included with this event.
