# Lifecycle

{% hint style="warning" %}
In version 4 of the iOS SDK, this implementation was completed automatically.

The Experience Platform SDK will not automatically collect Lifecycle metrics. To continue collecting Lifecycle metrics, you must add code to your app. For more information, see [Manual Lifecycle Implementation](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/resources/upgrading-to-aep/manual-lifecycle-implementation).
{% endhint %}

Sessions contain information about the app's current lifecycle, such as the device information, the application install or upgrade information, the session start and pause times, the number of application launches, and additional context data that is provided by the developer through the `LifecycleStart` API. Session data is persisted, so it is available across application launches.

## Add Lifecycle to your app

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}
1. Import the library:

```java
   import com.adobe.marketing.mobile.*;
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS" %}
### Objective-C

1. Import the library:

```objectivec
 #import "ACPLifecycle.h"
 #import "ACPCore.h"
```

### Swift

1. In Swift, importing `ACPCore` also imports the necessary Lifecycle APIs:

```swift
import ACPCore
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="React Native" %}
### JavaScript

Import the Lifecycle extension

```jsx
import {ACPLifecycle} from '@adobe/react-native-acpcore';
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Flutter" %}
### Dart

Import the Lifecycle extension

```dart
import 'package:flutter_acpcore/flutter_acplifecycle.dart';
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cordova" %}
### Cordova

After creating your Cordova app and adding the Android and iOS platforms, the Lifecycle extension for Cordova can be added with this command:

```text
cordova plugin add https://github.com/adobe/cordova-acpcore.git
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Unity" %}
### C\#

After importing the [ACPCore.unitypackage](https://github.com/adobe/unity-acpcore/blob/master/bin/ACPCore-0.0.1-Unity.zip), the Lifecycle extension for Unity can be added with following code in the MainScript

```csharp
using com.adobe.marketing.mobile;
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Xamarin" %}
### C\#

After adding the iOS ACPCore NuGet package or the Android ACPLifecycle NuGet package, the Lifecycle extension can be added by this import statement

```csharp
using Com.Adobe.Marketing.Mobile;
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Register Lifecycle with Mobile Core and add appropriate Start/Pause calls

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}
1. Register the Lifecycle extension:

   ```java
   public class TargetApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        MobileCore.setApplication(this);

        try {
            Lifecycle.registerExtension();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            //Log the exception
        }
    }
   }
   ```

2. In the `onResume` function, start the lifecycle data collection:

   ```java
      @Override  
      public void onResume() {  
         MobileCore.setApplication(getApplication());
         MobileCore.lifecycleStart(null);
      }
   ```

   Setting the application is only necessary on activities that are entry points for your application. However, setting the application on each Activity has no negative impact and ensures that the SDK always has the necessary reference to your application. We recommend that you call `setApplication`in each of your activities.

3. In the `onPause` function, pause the lifecycle data collection:

   ```java
      @Override
      public void onPause() {
         MobileCore.lifecyclePause();
      }
   ```

   To ensure accurate session and crash reporting, this call must be added to every activity.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS" %}
1. Register the Lifecycle extension with the SDK Core by adding the following to your app's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` delegate method:

   ```objectivec
   - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
     // register the lifecycle extension
    [ACPLifecycle registerExtension];
     return YES;
   }
   ```

2. Start Lifecycle data collection by calling `lifecycleStart:` from within the callback of the `ACPCore::start:` method in your app's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` delegate method.

   If your iOS application supports background capabilities, your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method might be called when iOS launches your app in the background. If you do not want background launches to count towards your lifecycle metrics, then `lifecycleStart:` should only be called when the application state is not equal to `UIApplicationStateBackground`.

   ```objectivec
   - (BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
       // register the lifecycle extension
       [ACPLifecycle registerExtension];

       const UIApplicationState appState = application.applicationState;
       [ACPCore start:^{
           // only start lifecycle if the application is not in the background
           if (appState != UIApplicationStateBackground) {
               [ACPCore lifecycleStart:nil];
           }
       }];
   }
   ```

3. When launched, if your app is resuming from a backgrounded state, iOS might call your `applicationWillEnterForeground:` delegate method. You also need to call `lifecycleStart:`, but this time you do not need all of the supporting code that you used in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`:

   ```objectivec
   - (void) applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application {
       [ACPCore lifecycleStart:nil];
   }
   ```

   In iOS 13 and later, for a scene-based application, use the `UISceneDelegate`'s `sceneWillEnterForeground` method as follows:

   ```objectivec
   - (void) sceneWillEnterForeground:(UIScene *)scene {
      [ACPCore lifecycleStart:nil];
   }
   ```

   For more information on handling foregrounding applications with Scenes, refer to Apple's documentation [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_foreground?language=objc)

4. When the app enters the background, pause Lifecycle data collection from your app's `applicationDidEnterBackground:` delegate method:

   ```objectivec
    - (void) applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application {
       [ACPCore lifecyclePause];
    }
   ```

   In iOS 13 and later, for a scene-based application, use the `UISceneDelegate`'s `sceneDidEnterBackground` method as follows:

   ```objectivec
   - (void) sceneDidEnterBackground:(UIScene *)scene {
      [ACPCore lifecyclePause];
   }
   ```

   For more information on handling backgrounding applications with Scenes, refer to Apple's documentation [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background?language=objc)

### Swift

1. Register the Lifecycle extension with the SDK Core by adding the following to your app's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` delegate method:

   ```swift
   func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
       // register the lifecycle extension
       ACPLifecycle.registerExtension();
   }
   ```

2. Start Lifecycle data collection by calling `lifecycleStart:` from within the callback of the `ACPCore::start:` method in your app's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` delegate method.

   If your iOS application supports background capabilities, your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method might be called when iOS launches your app in the background. If you do not want background launches to count towards your lifecycle metrics, then `lifecycleStart:` should only be called when the application state is not equal to `UIApplicationStateBackground`.

   ```swift
   func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
       // register the lifecycle extension
       ACPLifecycle.registerExtension();

       let appState = application.applicationState;            
       ACPCore.start {
           // only start lifecycle if the application is not in the background    
           if appState != .background {
               ACPCore.lifecycleStart(nil)
           }    
       }    
   }
   ```

3. When launched, if your app is resuming from a backgrounded state, iOS might call your `applicationWillEnterForeground:` delegate method. You also need to call `lifecycleStart:`, but this time you do not need all of the supporting code that you used in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`:

   ```swift
   func applicationWillEnterForeground(_ application: UIApplication) {    
       ACPCore.lifecycleStart(nil)
   }
   ```

   In iOS 13 and later, for a scene-based application, use the `UISceneDelegate`'s `sceneWillEnterForeground` method as follows:

   ```swift
   func sceneWillEnterForeground(_ scene: UIScene) {
        ACPCore.lifecycleStart(nil)
   }
   ```

   For more information on handling foregrounding applications with Scenes, refer to Apple's documentation [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_foreground)

4. When the app enters the background, pause Lifecycle data collection from your app's `applicationDidEnterBackground:` delegate method:

   ```swift
   func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {    
       ACPCore.lifecyclePause()
   }
   ```

   In iOS 13 and later, for a scene-based application, use the `UISceneDelegate`'s `sceneDidEnterBackground` method as follows:

   ```swift
   func sceneDidEnterBackground(_ scene: UIScene) {
        ACPCore.lifecyclePause()
   }
   ```

{% tab title="React Native" %}
**Registering the extension with Core:**

When using React Native, registering Lifecycle with Mobile Core should be done in native code which is shown under the Android and iOS tabs.

> Note: Implementing Lifecycle via JavaScript may lead to inaccurate Lifecycle metrics, therefore we recommend implementing Lifecycle in native Android and iOS code. However, these APIs are still provided in JavaScript to support flexible Lifecycle implementations.

**Starting a lifecycle event:**

```jsx
ACPCore.lifecycleStart({"lifecycleStart": "myData"});
```

**Pausing a lifecycle event:**

```jsx
ACPCore.lifecyclePause();
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cordova" %}
When using Cordova, registering Lifecycle with Mobile Core must be done in native code which is shown under the Android and iOS tabs.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Unity" %}
**Starting and Pausing a lifecycle event:** Add the OnApplicationPause in the MainScript with the following code:

```csharp
private void OnApplicationPause(bool pauseStatus)
{
  if (pauseStatus)
  {
    ACPCore.LifecyclePause();
  }
  else
  {
    var cdata = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    cdata.Add("launch.data", "added");
    ACPCore.LifecycleStart(cdata);
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Xamarin" %}
**iOS**

1. Register the Lifecycle extension with the SDK Core by adding the following to your app's `FinishedLaunching:` delegate method:

   ```csharp
   public override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication app, NSDictionary options)
   {
     ACPLifecycle.RegisterExtension();
     return base.FinishedLaunching(app, options);
   }
   ```

2. Start Lifecycle data collection by calling `LifecycleStart:` from within the callback of the `ACPCore::start:` method in your app's `FinishedLaunching:` delegate method.

   If your iOS application supports background capabilities, your `FinishedLaunching:` method might be called when iOS launches your app in the background. If you do not want background launches to count towards your lifecycle metrics, then `LifecycleStart:` should only be called when the application state is not equal to `UIApplicationState.Background`.

   ```csharp
   public override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication app, NSDictionary options)
   {
     ACPLifecycle.RegisterExtension();

     // only start lifecycle if the application is not in the background
     var appstate = app.ApplicationState;
     if(appstate != UIApplicationState.Background)
     {
       ACPCore.LifecycleStart(null);
     }
     return base.FinishedLaunching(app, options);
   }
   ```

3. When launched, if your app is resuming from a backgrounded state, iOS might call your `WillEnterForeground:` delegate method. You also need to call `LifecycleStart:`, but this time you do not need all of the supporting code that you used in `FinishedLaunching:`:

   ```csharp
   public override void WillEnterForeground(UIApplication uiApplication)
   {
     base.WillEnterForeground(uiApplication);
     ACPCore.LifecycleStart(null);
   }
   ```

4. When the app enters the background, pause Lifecycle data collection from your app's `DidEnterBackground:` delegate method:

   ```csharp
   public override void DidEnterBackground(UIApplication uiApplication)
   {
     base.DidEnterBackground(uiApplication);
     ACPCore.LifecyclePause();
   }
   ```

**Android**

1. Register the Lifecycle extension:

   ```csharp
   protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
   {
     base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);
    LoadApplication(new App());
     ACPCore.Application = this.Application;
     ACPLifecycle.RegisterExtension();
   }
   ```

2. In the `onResume` function, start the lifecycle data collection:

   ```csharp
   protected override void OnResume()
   {
     base.OnResume();
     ACPCore.LifecycleStart(null);
   }
   ```

   Setting the application is only necessary on activities that are entry points for your application. However, setting the application on each Activity has no negative impact and ensures that the SDK always has the necessary reference to your application. We recommend that you set the application \(`ACPCore.Application = this.Application;`\) in each of your activities.

3. In the `onPause` function, pause the lifecycle data collection:

   ```csharp
   protected override void OnPause()
   {
     base.OnPause();
     ACPCore.LifecyclePause();
   }
   ```

   To ensure accurate session and crash reporting, this call must be added to every activity.
