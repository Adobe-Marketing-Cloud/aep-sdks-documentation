## lifecycle.sessionTimeout

Specifies the length of time, in seconds, that must elapse between the time the app is launched and before the launch is considered to be a new session. This timeout also applies when your application is sent to the background and reactivated.

Default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

**Tip**: The time that your app spends in the background is not included in the session length.
