# Lifecycle extension in iOS

{% hint style="warning" %}
In version 4 of the iOS SDK, this implementation was completed automatically.

When upgrading to the Experience Platform SDK, you must add code to continue collecting Lifecycle metrics. For more information, see [Manual Lifecycle Implementation](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/resources/upgrading-to-aep/manual-lifecycle-implementation).

## Implementing Lifecycle metrics in iOS

For implementation details, please reference [Register Lifecycle with Mobile Core and Add Appropriate Start/Pause calls](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core/lifecycle#register-lifecycle-with-mobile-core-and-add-appropriate-start-pause-calls).

## Tracking app crashes in iOS

This information helps you understand how crashes are tracked and the best practices to handle false crashes.

**Important**: You should upgrade to Adobe Experience Platform SDKs, which contains critical changes that prevent false crashes from being reported.

**How does crash reporting work?**

When creating a new lifecycle session, the SDK looks for a variable it maintains in `NSUserDefaults` that indicates the previous session was paused. If the flag is not set, then the ensuing launch will also be treated as a crash.

The variable is controlled by calls to `lifecyclePause` \(which sets the flag\) and `lifecycleStart` \(which clears the flag\).

**Why does Adobe measure crashes this way?**

This approach of measuring crashes provides a high-level answer to the question, _Did the user exit my app intentionally?_

Crash reporting libraries provided by companies such as Apteligent \(formerly Crittercism\) use a global `NSException` handler to provide more detailed crash reporting. Your app is not allowed to have more than one of these kinds of handlers. Adobe decided to not implement a global `NSException` handler to prevent build errors, knowing that our customers might be using other crash reporting providers.

**What can cause a false crash to be reported?**

The following scenarios are known to falsely cause a crash to be reported by the SDK:

* If you are debugging using Xcode, re-launching the app while it is running in the foreground will cause a crash.

**Tip:** You can avoid a crash in this scenario by backgrounding the app prior to re-launching the app from Xcode.

* If your app is launched in the background because of an enabled background capability \(e.g. - background fetch, location update\), then `lifecycleStart` is called and the app never comes to the foreground, the next launch \(whether in the background or foreground\) will result in a crash.
* If you programmatically delete Adobeâ€™s pause flag from `NSUserDefaults`, while the app is in the background, the next launch or resume causes a crash.

**How can I prevent false crashes from being reported?**

The following practices can help prevent false crashes from being reported:

* Perform your development against non-production report suites to ensure there aren't false crashes from Xcode development.
* If your app has background capabilites, ensure that you are checking that the app is not in the background prior to calling `lifecycleStart`.
* Do not delete or modify any values that the Experience Platform SDKs puts in `NSUserDefaults`. If these values are modified outside the SDK, the data reported will be invalid.

## Collecting additional data with Lifecycle

When calling `lifecycleStart:`, you can optionally pass a dictionary of additional data that will be attached to the lifecycle event.

**Tip**: You can pass additional data to lifecycle on app launch, app resume, both, or neither.

```objectivec
// Objective-C
- (void) applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application {      
    [ACPCore lifecycleStart:@{@"state": @"appResume"}];      
}
```

```swift
// Swift
func applicationWillEnterForeground(_ application: UIApplication) {      
    ACPCore.lifecycleStart(["state": "appResume"])
}
```
