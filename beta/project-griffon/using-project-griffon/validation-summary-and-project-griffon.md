# Validation Summary

## Overview

You may use the Validation Summary feature to quickly and easily manage JavaScript functions to validate events in a Project Griffon session. Each function receives the events in a Project Griffon session. You can write functions to validate your client configuration, event conditions, tests and use cases.

## Getting Started

To use this view, complete the following steps:

1. [Setup Project Griffon](../set-up-project-griffon.md)
2. [Create](./#creating-sessions) and [connect](./#connecting-to-a-session) to a Project Griffon session
3. In the **Home** view, select **Validation Summary**

## Validation Management

When the view is loaded, it provides a panel on the left that contains a categorized list of validation results and a panel on the right to create and edit JavaScript validation functions.

## Writing a Validation Function

This feature allows you to create, edit, or delete validation functions for your Project Griffon sessions.

1. Select **Create a New Validation**.
2. Enter a **name** to identify the validation, then provide a **category** and a **description**.
3. Edit the code in the editor to validate the events for your Project Griffon session.
4. Click **Test** to preview the results of the function in the left panel.

After you have tested your function, you can click **Upload** to save your validation.

### Event Definition

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `uuid` | String | Universally unique identifier for the event. |
| `timestamp` | Number | Timestamp from the client when the event was sent to Project Griffon. |
| `eventNumber` | Number | Used to order when the event was sent. This key is useful when events have the same timestamp. |
| `vendor` | String | Vendor identification string in the reverse domain name format \(for example, com.adobe.griffon\). |
| `type` | String | Used to denote the type of event. |
| `payload` | Object | Defines the data for the event and contains unique and common properties. Some common properties include `ACPExtensionEventSource and ACPExtensionEventType`. |
| `annotations` | Array | An array of annotation objects. |

### Annotation Definition

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `uuid` | String | Universally unique identifier for the annotation. |
| `type` | String | Used to denote the type of annotation and is usually the name of the plugin \(for example, analytics\). |
| `payload` | Object | Defines the data that should supplement the event. For Adobe Analytics, this is where the post-processed hit data is contained. |

### Returning Validation Results

To execute the function in the code editor, click **Test**. The function is expected to return an object that contains the following:

| Key | Type | Description |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `message` | String | The validation message to display in the summary results. |  |  |
| `events` | Array | An array of event uuids to be reported as matched or not matched. |  |  |
| `result` | 'matched' | 'not matched' | 'unknown' | This is the validation result and is expected to be one of the enumerated strings. |

## Viewing Results

The left panel displays the results of all enabled validations, including the tested function in the right panel.

When a validation result is `unknown` or `not matched` and the `events` array has one or more `uuids`, the left panel will render a link with the count of events that are not matched. Clicking on the link will render a popover that contains a list of views. Selecting one of the views will navigate you to that view and will select those events not matched.

## Troubleshooting

If an error occurs in the JavaScript code editor, an `ERROR` status is displayed, and the reason for the error is output to the browser's developer console.
