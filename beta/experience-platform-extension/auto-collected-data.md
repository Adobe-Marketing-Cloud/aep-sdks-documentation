# Auto collected data

The Adobe Experience Platform Edge mobile extension automatically collects and adds information to each Experience event that is sent to the Edge Network. The following sections provide details about the collected information:

## Experience event

The [Experience Event](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/master/docs/reference/context/experienceevent.schema.md) is a time-based record of an event. The XDM Experience Event schema is the top-level class for all Experience events and contains information about the event, device, environment, and the identity of the user. Here are the properties the AEP Edge mobile extension automatically adds to each Platform event:

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Timestamp | The time when the event occurred. The timestamp is set when the Experience event is received by the AEP Edge mobile extension. |
| ID | A unique identifier for the time-series event. |

## Identity

The [IdentityMap](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/1c22180490558e3c13352fe3e0540cb7e93c69ca/docs/reference/context/identitymap.schema.md) defines a map that contains end-user identities. Here are the identity properties the AEP Edge mobile extension automatically adds to each Experience event:

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ECID | The Experience Cloud Identifier (ECID)  that is generated by the Adobe Experiece Platform Mobile SDK is added to the Experience event's `IdentityMap` . If the event contains an `IdentityMap` object, the ECID is added to the `IdentityMap` If the event does not contain the object, a new object is created and is added to the Experience event. |
