# Overview

_Implementing the Experience Cloud in Mobile iOS Applications_ is the perfect starting point for mobile app developers who want to learn how to implement the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions in their iOS apps.

Each lesson contains how-to exercises and foundational information to help you implement the Experience Cloud and understand its value.  A demo Swift app is provided for you to complete the tutorial, so you can learn the underlying techniques in a safe environment. After completing this tutorial, you should be ready to start implementing all of your marketing solutions through Launch in your own iOS app!

After completing this tutorial you will be able to:

* Create a mobile Launch Property

* Install a Launch Property in a mobile app

* Implement the following Adobe Experience Cloud solutions:
  * **[Experience Cloud ID Service](id-service.md)**
  * **[Adobe Target](target.md)**
  * **[Adobe Analytics](analytics.md)**
  * **[Adobe Audience Manager](audience-manager.md)**

<!--* ??? Create rules and data elements to send data to the Adobe solutions-->

<!--* Validate the implementation using the Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger-->

* Publish changes in Launch through development, staging, and production environments

## Prerequisites

In these lessons, it is assumed that you have an Adobe Id and the required permissions to complete the exercises. If not, you may need to reach out to your Experience Cloud Administrator to request access.

* For Launch, you must have permission to Develop, Approve, Publish, Manage Extensions, and Manage Environments. For more information on Launch permissions, see [the documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/admin/manage-permissions.html?lang=en).

Also, it is assumed that you are familiar with iOS development in Swift. You do not need to be a master of Swift to complete the lessons, but you will get more out of them if you can comfortably read and understand code.

## About Launch

Launch, by Adobe is the next generation of mobile SDK and website tag management capabilities from Adobe. Launch gives customers a simple way to deploy and manage all of the analytics, marketing, and advertising solutions necessary to power relevant customer experiences. There is no additional charge for Launch. It is available to any Adobe Experience Cloud customer.

## About the Lessons

In these lessons, you will implement the Adobe Experience Cloud into a fake bus company app called "[Bus Booking](assets/iOS_Standalone.zip)". The App has some simple capabilities that will allow you to complete an Experience Cloud mobile implementation before you move on to your own app. You will build your own Launch property, in your own Experience Cloud organization, and implement in a local copy of the Bus Booking app.
