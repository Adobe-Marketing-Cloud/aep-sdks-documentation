# Add Adobe Analytics to Your App

In this lesson, you will enable Adobe Analytics tracking in your app. This will include "Lifecycle" metrics (environment-based information), as well as tracking screen loads and user actions.

[Adobe Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics.html?lang=en) is an industry-leading solution that empowers you to understand your customers as people and steer your business with customer intelligence.

In the lesson [Add Extensions](launch-add-extensions.md), you added the analytics extension to your Launch property. In the lesson [Install the Mobile SDK](launch-install-the-mobile-sdk.md) you imported the extension into the sample application. These steps have prepared you to track your app in Adobe Analytics. Now all you have to do is identify the screens and actions in your app that you want to send to Analytics, and you are ready to go.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Verify that Lifecycle metrics are up and running in your app, after the basic SDK implementation
* Add code to track pages/screens that load on your app, as well as sending additional data along with the page load hit
* Add code to track actions in your app, as well as sending additional data along with the hit

There are many things that could be implemented for Analytics in Launch. This lesson is not exhaustive, but should give you a solid overview of the main techniques you will need for implementing in your own app.

## Prerequisites

You should have already completed the lessons in the [Configure Launch](launch-create-a-property.md) section. In that section, and in Adobe Launch, you will have already set up your configuration, including the tracking server and report suite ID(s).

## Lifecycle Metrics

Lifecycle metrics are environment-based metrics and dimensions that can be easily enabled in an app using the Experience Platform SDK. A quick line of code nets you a host of information, as shown in the [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/mobile-services/ios/metrics.html?lang=en) (this link going to iOS docs - of course the Android equivalent is available as well).

In the [Configure Launch](launch-create-a-property.md) section of this tutorial, you copied code from your Adobe Launch mobile property, and you pasted it into your sample project. This enabled Lifecycle metrics. But let's take a look at exactly which part does the magic.

### Locating the Lifecycle Code in Xcode

To be honest, Lifecycle metrics are actually part of the Core extension, which was added to your mobile property in Adobe Launch, and which you imported and registered in the sample app.

1. To see this, open AppDelegate.swift in Xcode, and see the imported library:

    ![Import ACPCore Library](images/mobile-analytics-importACPCoreLibrary.png)

1. Next look at the code that you pasted into the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions function, and you will see that the Lifecycle metrics tracking is started within the ACPCore initialization:

![Start Lifecycle Tracking](images/mobile-analytics-startLifecycleTracking.png)

That's it! That one line of code starts tracking Lifecycle metrics, and even though it is part of the core extension, one of the places that it sends the Lifecycle data is to Analytics. Next we'll look at the data being sent.

### Viewing the LifeCycle Hit

Although you can see the Lifecycle hits in any debugging program/packet sniffer, we will simply show them in the Xcode debugging console.

1. After validating your Lifecycle code in the previous exercise, build and run your project in Xcode so that it launches the simulator
1. In the Xcode debugging console, type `lifecycle` into the filter at the bottom to limit what shows up, and then scroll to the bottom of the entries
1. Notice that the `Analytics request was sent with body`
1. See values in the hit, including things like AppID, CarrierName, DayOfWeek, DaysSinceFirstUse, and other metrics/dimensions listed in the documentation

## Track Pages or Screens in Your App

In your app, you may have many different screens of content that you are providing for your users. This is the equivalent of pages on the Web. Adobe Analytics provides a method for you to send in these "page view hits" and view them in the same reports that you are used to for your Web properties. This method is called "trackState."
In this tutorial we will code a trackState into only one screen (page) in your app. In real life, you will replicate this on all of the other screens or pages in your app.
In this exercise, we will also explore a few different ways of sending data (key/value pairs) in with the hit.

It's also helpful to recognize that the trackState method has been moved from the Analytics code libraries to the Core code libraries, so that you can send data to other solutions besides Analytics. The documentation has it listed for both Android and iOS, including Objective-C and Swift. In this section of the tutorial, we will continue to focus on iOS and Swift.

Following is syntax and a code example from the documentation that you can use as you do the exercises or code your own app.

**Syntax:**
`+ (void) trackState: (nullable NSString*) state data: (nullable NSDictionary*) data;`

**Example**
`[ACPCore trackState:@"state name" data:@{@"key":@"value"}];`

### Send and View a Basic Page Hit With No Extra Data

1. With the sample app open in Xcode, go to BookingViewController.swift, and in the "super.viewDidLoad()" function, add a trackState method call
1. Set the `state name` to "Home Screen"
1. Instead of adding any extra data, add `nil` as a placeholder in the method call

![Basic trackState Call](images/mobile-analytics-basicTrackState.png)

**See the Results**

1. Save, build and run the project
1. When the simulator runs and opens the main page of the app, view the Xcode console
1. Filter the console to entries with "home" and look at the bottom entry which shows that the `Analytics request was sent with body`
1. Note that pageName is set to Home Screen, and there are no other custom data pairs

![Basic trackState Result](images/mobile-analytics-basicTrackStateResult1.png)

### Send and View a Page Hit With Data

1. Go back into BookingViewController.swift, and in the "super.viewDidLoad()" function, comment out (or delete) the basic (no data added) trackState call from the last exercise
1. Add a new trackState method call, this time with data, using `key1` as the key and `value1` as the value
1. Leave the `state name` to "Home Screen"

![Basic trackState Call](images/mobile-analytics-trackStateWithData1.png)

**See the Results**

1. Having stopped the simulator from the last exercise, save, build and run the project again
1. When the simulator runs and opens the main page of the app, view the Xcode console
1. Leave the filter as "home" and look at the bottom entry which shows that the `Analytics request was sent with body`
1. Now see that in addition to the pageName being set, you also have the key/value pair that was sent in on the hit

![Basic trackState Result](images/mobile-analytics-trackStateWithDataResult1.png)

#### Additional Data-Sending Options

In the previous two sections you have sent 1) no data, and then 2) one key/value pair. However, what if you want to send multiple data points to Analytics with a page load. Following are two options.

##### Option 1: Multiple Key/Value Pairs

In the trackState call, you have the option of sending multiple key/value pairs, simply by comma separating them in the data set. For example:
`ACPCore.trackState("Home Screen", data: ["key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"])`

##### Option 2: Dictionary Object

You can also define a dictionary in your code and then send that in with the trackState as well. Of course, if you have already defined some dictionary objects in your code, and want to send them into Analytics, this can be the perfect option for you. For example:
`let pageInfo = ["key1":"value1", "key2":"value2", "key3":"value3"]`
 `ACPCore.trackState("Home Screen", data: pageInfo)`

**Extra Credit**
Go ahead and try these two options out in your code, viewing the results in the Xcode debugging console. You can use the same filter as before, and check the results to make sure that you have the variables and values coming through

## Track Actions in Your App

Similar to tracking non-page-load actions on a Web site, we often want to track an action that a user takes in our app, E.g. clicks on things that don't load another screen. This is handled very similarly to the trackState we used above, except that this method is called `trackAction`.

Following is syntax and a code example from the documentation that you can use as you do the exercises or code your own app.

**Syntax:**
`+ (void) trackAction: (nullable NSString*) action data: (nullable NSDictionary*) data;`

**Example**
`ACPCore.trackAction("action name", data: ["key": "value"])`

### Track Interaction with the 'NonStop' Checkbox

In this sample bus booking app, there is a checkbox that let's users decide if they want to limit their search results to  options. We have decided that we want to track the interaction with that checkbox in Adobe Analytics.

![NonStop Checkbox](images/mobile-analytics-nonstopCheckbox.png)

This checkbox is controlled in the BookingViewController.swift file in the sample project. In this exercise, you will send a trackAction hit when people check the box, and another one if they uncheck the box, setting "on" or "off" to a variable, respectively.

#### Setting the trackAction Code

1. With the sample project open in Xcode, go to BookingViewController.swift, and locate the "nonStopButtonToggled" function
1. In the `if` statement, the first sections deselects the box if it is already selected. Therefore, we want to send in a hit that sets a value to "off", using the following code:

    `ACPCore.trackAction("NonStop Button Interaction", data: ["NonStop": "off"])`

1. In the next section (the "else" section), it checks the box if it isn't already checked. Therefore, we want to send in a hit that sets a value to "on", since they are checking the box:

    `ACPCore.trackAction("NonStop Button Interaction", data: ["NonStop": "on"])`

Notice the other customizations in the code:

* We are setting the `action name` to "NonStop Button Interaction." This is the value that will be in the "action" parameter, as well as the name of the custom link, going into the custom link report/dimension in Adobe Analytics
* The name of the `key` we are using is "NonStop." This is the key name that we can look for in Processing Rules in the Analytics Admin Console, so that we can map these values to a prop or eVar.

The function now looks like this:

![NonStop Checkbox](images/mobile-analytics-nonStopButtonCode.png)

#### See the Code in Action

1. After adding the code, save the project, run and build
1. Click the garbage icon to clear the debugger console
1. Check the box in the simulator, noticing that instantly there are 2 hits in the debugger coming up. The last one is the sending of the data to Adobe Analytics from the code we just placed
1. Notice that both the action and pev2 parameters are set to "NonStop Button Interaction" (with encoded spaces)
1. Notice that the "NonStop=on" key/value pair are present, and can then be assigned to a prop/eVar in Processing Rules
1. Notice the "pe=lnk_o" key/value, showing that this is a "custom link" hit, triggered by trackAction

Nice work! You have completed the Analytics section. Of course, there are many other things that you can do to enhance our Analytics implementation, but hopefully this has given you some of the core skills you will need to tackle the rest of your needs.
