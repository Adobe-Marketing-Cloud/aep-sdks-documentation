# Add the Experience Cloud ID Service

The [Experience Cloud ID Service](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/) sets a common visitor id across all Adobe solutions in order to power Experience Cloud capabilities such as audience-sharing between solutions.  You can also send your own customer ids to the Service to enable cross-device targeting and integrations with your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.

The ID Service is part of the Mobile Core extension, so you have already implemented it!
