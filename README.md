## Bring the Adobe Experience Cloud to your apps

The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK helps power Adobe's Experience Cloud solutions and services in your mobile apps.

The SDK is comprised of the Mobile Core and a series of modular Adobe Experience Cloud solutions or third-party vendor extensions that depend on the Mobile Core. Extensions interact with the Mobile Core to provide features specific to the solution or service they represent.

Experience Platform Mobile SDKs are available for Android, iOS, and a [variety](./#supported-platforms) of cross-platform development frameworks. SDKs configuration is managed via Adobe Experience Platform Launch for flexible configuration and extensible, rules-based integrations.
