## Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs

We are excited to announce that the Adobe Experience Platform Swift mobile extensions are here! In addition to the Adobe Experience Cloud Solution extensions, the AEP Mobile SDKs enable features for AEP Edge Network and AEP Data Collection, support for SPM and many more.

These extensions are based on the latest AEPCore 3.x mobile extension. If you are looking for the ACPCore 2.x based extensions documentation, find the supported platforms bellow.
