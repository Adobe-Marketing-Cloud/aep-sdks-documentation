## Frequently asked questions

### Why is the support for the version 4 SDKs ending?

The version 4 SDKs were first released in September 2013 to support mobile app implementations for Adobe Analytics \(including Mobile Services\), Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Target, and Adobe Campaign. These performant, well-tested SDKs provided rich functionality and are used in well over 18,000 apps across app stores.

Spurred by customer feedback for more control, performance, and functionality over the years; and to support future product enhancements, we released the re-architected [Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs](./) in September 2018. The new Experience Platform Mobile SDKs replaces the version 4 SDKs and provide support for new features such as flexible configuration through Experience Platform Launch, modular Adobe and partner extensions. 

Solutions such as Places Service and [Project Griffon](beta/project-griffon/) are exclusively available on Experience Platform Mobile SDKs.
