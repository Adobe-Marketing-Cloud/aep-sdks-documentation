# Configure Datastreams

For mobile data collection via the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network, the configuration of the Experience Platform Mobile SDK is now split between two workflows within [Experience Platform Launch](https://launch.adobe.com):

{% hint style="warning" %}
To create an Datastream, your organization must be provisioned for this feature in Adobe Experience Platform Launch. Please contact your Adobe Customer Success Manager \(CSM\) to be added to the _allow list_.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Datastreams tool is available to customers on the _allow list_ regardless whether they use Experience Platform Launch for web tag management or to manage mobile app configuration.

Users will require _Develop_ permissions in Experience Platform Launch. See the [User Permissions](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/launch/using/reference/admin/user-permissions.html) article in the Experience Platform Launch documentation for more details.
{% endhint %}

1. Create a Datastream - The Datastream contains settings for Adobe solutions and services and is setup server-side \(instead of client-side\). The Datastream is identified to the Mobile SDK by edgeConfigId \(via the Edge Network Extension\).
2. Setting up a mobile property - As previously done, users will need to create and setup a mobile property and add the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network extension \(and other extensions as needed\) to obtain install instructions and the client environment ID.

To create a new Datatstream follow the steps below:

1. In the browser, navigate to [Adobe Experience Platform Launch](https://experience.adobe.com/launch) and login with your credentials.
2. From the left panel, choose **Datatstreams** from the dropdown \(instead of **Client Side**\).
3. Click **New Datatstream** \(located on top right\)
4. Set a name for the configuration and click **Save**.

1. In the next screen, toggle on **Adobe Experience Platform** and:
   1. Select the appropriate **Sandbox** from the dropdown
   2. Choose the appropriate **Event Dataset** as previously created
2. Once you have made your selections click `Save`.

In the resulting summary screen, you will see that three environments have been created for your Datatstream. If needed, each environment can be edited individually with different configuration parameters.

Make note of the listed, Launch Datatstream **Environment ID**s, as these values will be referenced when you setup the mobile property in the next step.
