## Do I need additional permissions to create a mobile property in Experience Platform Launch?

If you need access to Experience Platform Launch, see the [user permissions document](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/admin/user-permissions.html?lang=en). If you create a web property, you can also create a mobile property. If you do not see the option to create a mobile property, turn off your ad blocker, and refresh the page.

## Should I create one property per app or multiple properties per app platform?

If your apps send data to the same Adobe Analytics report suites, use the same extensions, rules, and data elements. You should group all of these mobile apps into the same property. If your apps send data to different Adobe Analytics report suites or user different extensions per app, create separate mobile properties. If you group your mobile apps into one property, you can also split them into separate properties over time.

## How do I delete a mobile property in Adobe Experience Platform Launch?

To delete a mobile property from Adobe Experience Platform Launch, please read the [delete a property tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/admin/companies-and-properties.html?lang=en#delete-a-property).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you delete a mobile property, you cannot undo this action!
{% endhint %}

## General implementation and migration

### Where can I download the SDK?

The Experience Platform SDK is available through [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), and [Github](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks/). For more information, please read the [get the SDK tutorial](../../getting-started/get-the-sdk.md).

### Can I use both the 4x SDK and the new Experience Platform SDK at the same time?

Implementing two the SDKs in your app is not supported.

The Experience Platform SDK migrates the locally stored user contexts from the 4x SDKs. Using both SDKs will cause severe data quality issues. For more information, please read the [upgrade to the Experience Platform SDKs tutorial](../upgrading-to-aep/).

### What platforms are supported?

For a complete list of supported platforms, please read the [latest SDK versions document](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/resources/upgrading-to-aep/current-sdk-versions).

### What OS and platform versions are supported?

* Android versions 4.0 or later \(API levels 14 or later\)
* iOS versions 10 or later
* React Native versions 0.44.0 or later
* Flutter versions 1.10.0 or later
* Cordova 9.0.0 or later
* Xamarin - MonoAndroid 9.0+ and Xamarin.iOS 1.0+
* Unity 2019.3.10f1or later

### Where does the SDK store identities and preferences on the app?

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}
The SDK uses the cache and shared preferences at these locations:

data/data/your.app.package/cache

data/data/your.app.package/shared\_prefs
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS" %}
The SDK uses `NSUserDefaults` using the prefix `adobe.*`.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### What is the size of the SDK?

| Extension | iOS \(KB\) | Android \(KB\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Core | 504 | 168 |
| Adobe Analytics | 54 | 21 |
| Adobe Audience Manager | 40 | 13 |
| Adobe Target | 77 | 27 |
| Profile | 20 | 8 |
| Adobe Campaign Standard | 60 | 30 |
| Places | 36 | 20 |
| Places Monitor | 10 | 19 |

The size values in the table are provided as indicative estimates, with the following considerations:

* Mobile Core, which includes the Lifecycle, the Identity, and the Signals extensions, is required for all other extensions. The final app size increase can be calculated by adding the Mobile Core size to each of the enabled extensions. For example, the iOS app distribution using the Target and Analytics extensions will have a total size increase of 635 KB. \(Core: 504 KB + Analytics: 54 KB + Target: 77 KB\).
* The iOS \(SDK extension versions 2+\) estimates are based on Xcode’s App Thinning size report for one architecture. The Android \(SDK extension versions 1+\) size estimates listed refer to unsigned apps and do not account for proguarding.

### How can I use ProGuard with the Android SDK?

Android developer documentation recommends that you should enable shrinking to remove unused code and resources in your release build to make your APK file as small as possible. For more information, please read the [shrink, obfuscate, and optimize your app tutorial](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code). Shrinking is accomplished by using [ProGuard](https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/android/sdk/android-sdk-linux/tools/proguard/docs/index.html#manual/introduction.html). The Experience Platform Mobile SDK for Android comes with default ProGuard rules that are included in the Core `AAR` package \(see `proguard.txt`\). You should use this default package when you implement.

Add the following rule to your custom ProGuard rules file, typically labeled `proguard-rules.pro`. For more information, please read the [shrink, obfuscate, and optimize your app tutorial](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code).

```java
-keep class com.adobe.marketing.mobile.* {
    <init>(...);
}
```

### How can I track user engagement of push notifications using the Experience Platform Mobile SDK?

Implementing push notification tracking and measurement with the SDK depends on the Experience Cloud solution being used.

* For the Adobe Campaign Standard extension, please read the [Adobe Campaign standard push tracking tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/administrating/configuring-mobile/push-tracking.html?lang=en).
* For the Adobe Campaign Classic extension, please read the [Adobe Campaign Classic push notifications tracking tutorial](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-campaignclassic/adobe-campaignclassic-api-reference#tracknotification-api).
* For the Adobe Analytics - Mobile Services extension, please read the [set up tracking for Mobile Services push notifications tutorial](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-analytics-mobile-services#set-up-push-tracking).

## Mobile Core

### What are Lifecycle metrics?

Lifecycle metrics are out-of-the-box metrics that are automatically collected when the SDK is first implemented in your app. For more information, please read the [documentation on Lifecycle metrics](../../foundation-extensions/mobile-core/lifecycle/).

## Adobe Analytics

### How can I set up, configure, or troubleshoot processing rules?

To learn about processing rules please read the [processing rules tips and tricks guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/processing-rules/processing-rules-tips.html?lang=en).

### How are mobile visits different from launches?

A launch is measured by the SDK when a user opens the app for the first time or returns to the app after having been out of the app for longer than the specified timeout value. The typical timeout is 5 minutes \(300 seconds\) in the [lifecycleTimeout](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core/lifecycle#configuration-keys) configuration setting.

A visit is a server-side calculation by Adobe Analytics and is based on the first and last data hits that are sent by the SDK without exceeding a visit timeout. Typically, session timeouts are set at 30 minutes for a report suite. Although visits come from traditional web analytics, these hits still provide valuable insights into how users enter and exit from your app.

### Can I send my analytics data to multiple report suites?

Yes. To capture data in multiple report suites, please read the [report suites guide](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-analytics#report-suites).

### I don't see data in my Adobe Analytics report suite - what can I do? <a id="i-dont-see-data-in-my-adobe-analytics-report-suite-what-can-i-do"></a>

If you have followed the documentation and are unable to see reporting data in your Adobe Analytics dashboard, please consider the following next steps:

#### Verify that network requests are sent to Adobe Analytics <a id="verify-that-network-requests-are-sent-to-adobe-analytics"></a>

You can use [Project Griffon](../../beta/project-griffon/) to verify events are being sent to Adobe Analytics.

#### Ensure appropriate time-stamp configuration <a id="ensure-appropriate-time-stamp-configuration"></a>

Ensure that your SDK timestamp configuration is aligned with the report suite's time stamp settings. That is, `analytics.offlineEnabled` in the SDK configuration block for the Launch mobile property is aligned with the setting of Timestamp Configuration in your report suite. You may find Timestamp at Analytics &gt; Admin &gt; Report Suites &gt; General &gt; Timestamp Configuration.

The following settings explain how settings between the SDK and your report suite should be aligned:

* `analytics.offlineEnabled = true` ties to timestamps required or optional
* `analytics.offlineEnabled = false` ties to timestamps not allowed or optional
