# Migrate to Swift

If you have implemented Objective-C versions \(ACP-prefixed SDK libraries, 2.x or lower\), then this guide will help you understand the steps required to migrate your implementation to the latest Swift versions \(AEP-prefixed SDK libraries, 3.x or higher\). In summary, you'll need to:

1. [Switch imported libraries from ACP-prefix to AEP-prefix libraries](migrate-to-swift.md#switch-imported-libraries)
2. [Update SDK initialization](migrate-to-swift.md#update-sdk-initialization)
3. [Update API references to call AEP-prefix libraries](migrate-to-swift.md#update-api-usage-and-references-for-each-extension)

## Switch imported libraries

At this time, the following ACP-prefix libraries may be switched out with their respective AEP-prefix SDK libraries. See instructions on proceeding further if you have [manually imported SDK libraries](migrate-to-swift.md#manual-library-import) , if you used [CocoaPods to manage SDK dependencies](migrate-to-swift.md#cocoapods), or you used [Swift Package Manager](migrate-to-swift.md#swift-package-manager).

{% hint style="warning" %}
In addition to `ACPCore` being replaced with `AEPCore`, you will also need to explicitly import `AEPLifecycle`, `AEPIdentity`, and `AEPSignal` libraries to ensure there is no disruption in SDK behavior.
{% endhint %}

| Objective-C \(ACP-prefix\) | Swift \(AEP-prefix\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| ACPCore | AEPCore/AEPLifecycle/AEPIdentity/AEPSignal |
| ACPUserProfile | AEPUserProfile |
| ACPAnalytics | AEPAnalytics |
| ACPAudience | AEPAudience |
| ACPTarget | AEPTarget |
| ACPMedia | AEPMedia |
| ACPPlaces | AEPPlaces |
| AEPAssurance \(1.x\) | AEPAssurance \(3.x\) |
| ACPCampaign | AEPCampaign |

### Manual library import

If you are manually importing SDK libraries, ensure you identify all currently used ACP-prefix libraries and switch them over to AEP-prefix libraries. The list of current AEP-prefix SDK libraries can be found in the [current SDK versions document](upgrading-to-aep/current-sdk-versions.md#ios-swift) \(in the Swift section\).

### CocoaPods

If you are using CocoaPods to manage your Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK dependencies, the following example shows you how to switch ACP-prefix libraries to AEP-prefix libraries in your `Podfile`.

```ruby
# replace ACPCore with AEPCore/AEPLifecycle/AEPIdentity/AEPSignal
# pod 'ACPCore'
  pod 'AEPCore'
  pod 'AEPLifecycle'
  pod 'AEPIdentity'
  pod 'AEPSignal'

# replace ACPUserProfile with AEPUserProfile
# pod 'ACPUserProfile'
  pod 'AEPUserProfile'
```

Save the `Podfile` and run `pod repo update` to update your local CocoaPods repository.

Once the previous command is complete, run `pod install` or `pod update` to update the application dependencies.

### Swift Package Manager

You can now also use Swift Package Manager (SPM) to manage your Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK dependencies. To add the AEP SDK Packages to your application, from the Xcode 13 menu select:

```
File > Add Packages...
```

Enter the Package URL for the AEP SDK repositories: 

- AEPCore: `https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-core-ios.git`
- AEPUserProfile: `https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-userprofile-ios.git`

For each package, specify the Dependency rule as a specific version or a range of versions and select the Project. 

When prompted, select all the `AEP*` libraries, then click `Add Package`.



Alternatively, if your project has a `Package.swift` file, you can add AEPCore and AEPUserProfile directly to your dependencies:

```ruby
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-core-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.0.0")),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-userprofile-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.0.0")),
],
targets: [
    .target(name: "YourTarget",
            dependencies: ["AEPCore", "AEPUserProfile"],
            path: "your/path"),
]
```

## Update SDK initialization

After you have imported the new Swift-based AEP-prefix libraries, you'll need to update SDK initialization code as described below. With Swift, the `MobileCore.start()` API is no longer required. The SDK has simplified initialization and registration of extensions by providing the `MobileCore.registerExtensions()` API. After the given extensions have been registered, the SDK will be initialized and the completion block will be executed. Code which used to reside in the start\(\) block will now reside in the `MobileCore.registerExtensions()` completion block.

The following code snippets show the new and correct initialization code required for the Swift-based, AEP-prefix SDK libraries.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Objective-C" %}
```text
@import AEPCore;
@import AEPSignal;
@import AEPLifecycle;
@import AEPIdentity;
@import AEPUserProfile;
@import AEPServices;
@import AEPAssurance;
...

// AppDelegate.m
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
      [AEPMobileCore setLogLevel: AEPLogLevelDebug];
      [AEPMobileCore registerExtensions:@[AEPMobileSignal.class, AEPMobileLifecycle.class, AEPMobileUserProfile.class, AEPMobileIdentity.class, AEPMobileAssurance.class] completion:^{
        [AEPMobileCore configureWithAppId: @"yourLaunchEnvironmentID"];
        [AEPMobileCore lifecycleStart:@{@"contextDataKey": @"contextDataVal"}];
        }];
    ...
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Swift" %}
```swift
// AppDelegate.swift
import AEPAssurance
import AEPCore
import AEPIdentity
import AEPLifecycle
import AEPSignal
import AEPUserProfile

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    MobileCore.registerExtensions([Signal.self, Lifecycle.self, UserProfile.self, Identity.self, Assurance.self], {
        MobileCore.configureWith(appId: "yourLaunchEnvironmentID")
        MobileCore.lifecycleStart(additionalContextData: ["contextDataKey": "contextDataVal"])
    })
  ...
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Update API usage and references for each extension

Finally, you'll need to scan through your current implementation and replace ACP-prefix API calls to the new Swift-based, AEP-prefix libraries. A quick find and replace should do the trick. Detailed API changes by extension may be found at the links below.
