# Attach data to SDK events

The attach data_rule action is supported in [Mobile Core](../../foundation-extensions/mobile-core/) starting from version 2.1.8 (Launch), 2.3.5 (iOS), and 1.4.5 (Android). This action is powerful, complex, and enables advanced use cases.

To use this action, you need to learn how events flow in the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK and how they interact with the [rules engine](../../foundation-extensions/mobile-core/rules-engine/). 

## Context

### What are SDK events?

In the Experience Platform Mobile SDK, events hold all the data that is required by other extensions to complete the necessary actions. Events have the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Type | Describes the event. Examples include Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, and Adobe Lifecycle. |
| Source | Indicates the cause or the directionality of the event. For example, a request or a response. |
| Event data | The data required to define the event. For example, context data on an Analytics event. |

Extensions that register with [Mobile Core](../../foundation-extensions/mobile-core/) will also register event listeners. A listener is defined by a combination of event type and source. When the SDK event hub processes an event, it notifies all listeners that match the provided combination.

### How are events created in the SDK?

Events are created by an extension and are dispatched to the SDK Event Hub. Each published rule that is created in Adobe Experience Platform Launch is evaluated against the current event. Finally, the event is passed to each of the listeners for events with the submitted type / source combination.

{% hint style="info" %}
Events are created and dispatched when an SDK public API is invoked. Attach data action use cases are meant to act on these types of events.
{% endhint %}

### What is the Rules Engine?

The Rules Engine lives in the SDK Event Hub. Before listeners are notified, the Rules Engine evaluates each Experience Platform Launch rule against the triggering event. A rule is defined by the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Event | Trigger for the rule. |
| Condition | Definition of the criteria to compare against the triggering event. |
| Action | The resulting action if the evaluation of the rule is positive. |

{% hint style="info" %}
A rule might be read out in the following way: If the SDK **Event** occurs and **Condition(s)** are met, then perform the **Action(s)**.
{% endhint %}

## Using the attach data action

**Attach Data** is a type of rule action that lets you add event data to an SDK event. The modification of data happens in the Rules Engine before event listeners are notified of the event.

{% hint style="info" %}
Attach data rule actions will only add data to the event. These actions never modify or remove data.

If there is a conflict between the data that is defined in your rule and the data in the event, the data in the event always has preference.
{% endhint %}

### Defining a payload for the attach data action

When defining a payload for the attach data action, the payload must match the format of the triggering event. For example, if you want to add context data to an Adobe Analytics event, you need to know where the context data is defined on that event and match the format in your rule. 

As a result, it is highly recommended to enable verbose logging in the SDK and carefully study the format of the event to which you will attach the data. If the format does not match, most likely the expected results will not be received.

## Example - attaching data to an event

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Analytics" %}
The following sample shows how to attach data to all outgoing `TrackAction` Analytics network requests. To create this type of rule, select your property in Experience Platform Launch and complete the following steps:

1. [Create a new rule](attach-data.md#analytics-create-rule)
2. [Select the event you want to trigger the rule](attach-data.md#analytics-select-an-event)
3. [Select the action to attach data and define your payload](attach-data.md#analytics-define-the-action)
4. [Save and rebuild the property](attach-data.md#analytics-save-the-rule-and-rebuild-your-property).

### Create a rule

1. On the **Rules** tab, click **Create New Rule**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not have existing rules for this property, the **Create New Rule** button will be in the middle of the screen. If your property has rules, the button will be in the top right of the screen.
{% endhint %}

### Select an event

1. Give your rule an easily recognizable name in your list of rules.

   In this example, the rule is named "Attach Places Data to Analytics Track Action Events".

2. Under the **Events** section, click **Add**.
3. From the **Extension** dropdown list, select **Mobile Core**.
4. From the **Event Type** dropdown list, select **Track Action**.
5. Click **Keep Changes**.

### Define the action

1. Under the **Actions** section, click **Add**.
2. From the **Extension** dropdown list, select **Mobile Core**.
3. From the **Action Type** dropdown list, select **Attach Data**.
4. On the right pane, in the **JSON Payload** field, type the data that will be added to this event.
5. Click **Keep Changes**.

On the right pane, you can add a freeform JSON payload that adds data to an SDK event before an extension that is listening for this event can hear the event. In this example, some context data is added to this event before the Adobe Analytics extension processes it. The added context data will now be on the outgoing Adobe Analytics hit.

In the following example, `launches` and `anAddedKey` keys are added to the `contextdata` of the Analytics event. Values for the new keys can either be hardcoded in the rule, or dynamically determined by the SDK when this event processes by using data elements.

### Save the rule and rebuild your property

After you complete your configuration, verify that your rule looks like the following:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/rulecomplete.png)

1. Click **Save**
2. Rebuild your Experience Platform Launch property and deploy it to the correct Environment.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Target" %}
{% hint style="warning" %}
The attach data feature applies **only** to the Target extension.
{% endhint %}

### Attach additional data to Target to retrieve location events

The following sample shows how to attach data to all outgoing `retrieveLocationContent` Target network requests. To create this type of rule, select your property in Experience Platform Launch and complete the following steps:

1. [Create a new rule](attach-data.md#target-create-rule)
2. [Select the event you want to trigger the rule](attach-data.md#target-select-an-event)
3. [Select the action to attach data and define your payload](attach-data.md#target-define-the-action)
4. [Save and rebuild the property](attach-data.md#target-save-the-rule-and-rebuild-your-property).

### Create a rule

1. On the **Rules** tab, click **Create New Rule**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not have existing rules for this property, the **Create New Rule** button will be in the middle of the screen. If your property has rules, the button will be in the top right of the screen.
{% endhint %}

### Select an event

1. Give your rule an easily recognizable name in your list of rules.

   In this example, the rule is named **Attach additional data to Target retrieve location Events**.

2. Under the **Events** section, click **Add**.
3. From the **Extension** dropdown list, select **Adobe Target**.
4. From the **Event Type** dropdown list, select **Content Requested**.

### Define the action

1. Under the **Actions** section, click **Add**.
2. From the **Extension** dropdown list, select **Mobile Core**.
3. From the **Action Type** dropdown list, select **Attach Data**.
4. On the right pane, in the **JSON Payload** field, type the data that will be added to this event.
5. Click **Keep Changes**.

On the right pane, you can add a freeform JSON payload that adds data to an SDK event before an extension that is listening for this event. 

In this example, a custom mbox with custom mbox parameters is added to the event before the Target extension processes it. The added custom mbox will now be added on outgoing Target retrieve location requests.

In the following example, an additional `TargetRequest` object for the given `custom_mbox`, which contains the provided Target parameters, is added to the Target event.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/target-attach-data-json-example.png)

In the above example, the JSON payload adds custom mbox parameters only for the custom mbox that was added. You can also add custom parameters to each of the Target retrieve location objects. The following example contains a valid JSON payload for this use case:

```javascript
{
    "request[*]": {
        "targetparams": {
            "profileparams": {
                "extraRetrieveLocationKey": "extraRetrieveLocationValue"
            },
            "mboxparameters": {
                "extraRetrieveLocationMboxKey": "extraRetrieveLocationMboxValue"
