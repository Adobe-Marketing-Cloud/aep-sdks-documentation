## Implement Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs in mobile applications

This tutorial guides you through the implementation of the Platform Mobile SDK in a sample retail app called Luma. The Luma app has functionality that lets you build a realistic implementation. The lessons are designed for iOS and written in Swift, but many of the concepts also apply to Android.

## Getting started with Adobe Experience Platform

This tutorial illustrates how you may send Experience Data Model (XDM) commerce events to Adobe Experience Platform via Experience Edge using the AEP Edge extension in a sample application, provided to you in iOS (Swift) and Android.

## Tracking Beacons in Mobile Android and iOS applications

Sending beacon data to Adobe Analytics for reporting can be an effective to understand how your audience can interact with physical landmarks. You can manually send beacon tracking data to your Analytics server and create rules based on a user's proximity to your beacons. This solution relies on the Profile extension to generate beacon-related rules.

## Attach or modify data in SDK events

In this tutorial you will learn how to enable advanced use-cases with Attach Data and Modify Data actions.

## Using data elements to define dynamic data in rules

Data elements are building blocks for rules and allow you create a data dictionary of commonly used data in the Platform Mobile SDK. This collection of data elements becomes the dictionary of defined data that you can use to build rules for your application, and this dictionary is shared across Experience Platform Launch where it can be used with any extension that is added to your mobile property.

## Signal extension and Rules Engine integration

Learn how to use Signal actions such as postbacks, openning a URL in your Data Collection rules by laveraging the client-side Rules Engine.
