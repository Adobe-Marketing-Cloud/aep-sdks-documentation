  The set up steps are now slightly different. For more information, see [Set up Project Griffon](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/beta/project-griffon/set-up-project-griffon).

The Project Griffon web UI now has new views specifically for users who are trying to inspect and improve Adobe Analytics and Location Service \(Places\) implementations.

**Adobe Analytics View**

The new Adobe Analytics view shows you events that are only related to your Adobe Analytics implementation. The list view now displays the action/state name and event, `status`, with a newly formatted detail view. `status` tells you when an SDK event is generated \(processed\), whether the SDK has made a network request with Adobe Analytics \(queued\), and whether post-processing information about the event \(validated\) is returned. This information helps you determine whether your context data is being appropriately mapped in Adobe Analytics.

The detailed view for an Analytics track event contains the following parts:

* The originating SDK Analytics request event.
* The OOTB meta and context data from the request, such as the report suite ID, the SDK extension versions, the OOTB context data, and so on.
* The post-processed information on the Analytics event, which contains mapping of revars, evars, props, and so on.

For more information, see [Adobe Analytics and Project Griffon](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/beta/project-griffon/using-project-griffon/adobe-analytics-and-project-griffon).

**Location Service \(Places\) View**

The new Location Services views allow you to inspect location entry and exit events on the Project Griffon web UI and on a mobile device. Depending on your business workflows, these views provide a convenient interface to view location-specific data points for inspection on the web/client for in-context debugging.
